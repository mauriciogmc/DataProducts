This small Shiny application demonstrates Shiny's automatic UI updates, integrated with GoogleVis Geo Chart interactive maps.   
Moving the slider *Ranking Filter* sets the first *N* most populated countries to be shown on the chart. Notice how the chart and the chart title change by moving the slider. Also, it's possible to increase the slider automatically, by clicking on the *play / pause* buttons, which also causes an update on chart.   
Additionally, user can select which region to zoom, by selecting one of the *Zoom Into Region* options.
